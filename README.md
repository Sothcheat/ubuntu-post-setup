# Ubuntu 25.04 Post-Install Setup

Automated post-installation setup scripts for Ubuntu 25.04 Desktop tailored for different user needs: a minimal beginner-friendly setup, and a comprehensive personal/developer setup with advanced features.

This repository contains two scripts:

- **`beginner-setup.sh`** â€” A minimal and universal setup script meant for beginners or general users who want to quickly install essential drivers, codecs, fonts, and utilities with minimal customization.
- **`personal-setup.sh`** â€” A full-featured script for personal or developer use, including IDEs, extensive developer tools, custom terminal theming, GPU driver selection, and desktop environment tweaking.

## Quick Start

You can run either script directly from the internet with a single command.

### Beginner-Friendly Setup (Minimal)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sothcheat/ubuntu-post-setup/main/beginner-setup.sh)"
```

or with `wget`:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sothcheat/ubuntu-post-setup/main/beginner-setup.sh)"
```

### Personal Full Setup (Developer & Power User)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sothcheat/ubuntu-post-setup/main/personal-setup.sh)"
```

or with `wget`:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sothcheat/ubuntu-post-setup/main/personal-setup.sh)"
```

## Important Notes

- You must have an active internet connection for the scripts to work properly.

- Scripts prompt for your confirmation at each major step, so they are safe to run unattended or interactively.
- Log files are stored in `~/ubuntu25-setup-logs/` for troubleshooting and review.
- A system reboot is recommended after script completion to finalize installations.
- Review and customize the script as needed before running to fit your preferences.
